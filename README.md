# Pong_AFK-slow-


Open https://www.ponggame.org and execute the code!!
It uses AI and tracks down the ball. Then it just follows it!

Please notice that the code runs slow, and you will probably still loose against the worst bot, this is due to the algorithm, using template matching, being very SLOW.
I tried implementing a coordinate system, that using math, calculates the next position, but it is too slow, and when it calculates the line graph, the ball has already crossed the finish line.

:(
probably wont add a V2, until I learn a better way to implement this
